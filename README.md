# What does this do?

This code conducts Bayesian estimation and hypothesis testing on data obtained from delay discounting (aka inter-temporal choice) experiments.

# Key features:

* Rather than estimating single values of delay discounting parameters (point estimates), we calculate a posterior distribution of belief over the parameters given the data.
* Hierarchical Bayesian estimation simultaneously estimates trial-level responses, and participant- and group-level parameters. 
* The widely used and easily interpreted 1-parameter hyperbolic discount function is used to not only estimate a participantâ€™s discount rate, but how that varies as a function of reward magnitude (the magnitude effect).
* The psychometric function incorporates measurement errors, that is, participant response errors.
