# Bayesian estimation and hypothesis testing for delay discounting tasks


THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS CODE FOR A PAPER WHICH IS UNDER PEER REVIEW. FOR THE MOMENT IT IS MADE AVAILABLE JUST FOR THE REVIEWERS. PLEASE RESPECT MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - THIS CODE IS UNDER LICENCE. I'LL RELEASE THE CODE PROPERLY IF THE PAPER IS ACCEPTED

# What does this do?
This code conducts Bayesian estimation and hypothesis testing on data obtained from delay discounting (aka inter-temporal choice) experiments. 

**Note: The code here is still in flux.** I will be: adding more extensive user instructions in the Wiki, cleaning and simplifying the code, and adding a few features over time.
