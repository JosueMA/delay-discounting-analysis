## What does this toolbox do?

This toolbox aims to be a complete solution for the analysis of experimental data from discounting tasks.

Key features:

* Bayesian estimates of discounting parameters, complete with credible intervals.
* Parameters exported to a `.csv` file for analysis in [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org).
* Optionally use hierarchical inference to improve participant-level estimates.
* A variety of models are available:
  * 1-parameter discount functions: exponential, hyperbolic.
  * 2-parameter discount functions: hyperboloid
  * Also, hyperbolic discounting + magnitude effect, where discount rates vary as a function of reward magnitude.
* Explicit modelling of participant errors provides more robust parameter estimates of discounting parameters.
* Posterior predictive checks help evaluate model goodness and aid data exclusion decisions.
* Publication quality figures.

## Questions, comments

Please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/drbenvincent/delay-discounting-analysis/issues) feature to ask question, report a bug, or request a feature. You'll need a GitHub account to do this, which isn't very hard to set up.

But you could always email me or tweet me [@inferenceLab](https://twitter.com/inferencelab) instead.

I'm very happy if people would like to contribute to the toolbox in any way. Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/drbenvincent/delay-discounting-analysis/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.
