## What does this toolbox do?

This toolbox aims to be a complete solution for the analysis of experimental data from discounting tasks.

Key features:

* Bayesian estimates of discounting parameters, complete with credible intervals.
* Parameters exported to a `.csv` file for analysis in [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org).
* Optionally use hierarchical inference to improve participant-level estimates.
* A variety of models are available:
  * Exponential discounting.
  * Hyperbolic discounting.
  * Hyperbolic discounting + magnitude effect, where discount rates vary as a function of reward magnitude.
* Explicit modelling of participant errors provides more robust parameter estimates of discounting parameters.
* Posterior predictive checks help evaluate model goodness and aid data exclusion decisions.
* Publication quality figures.

## Documentation and help.
Go to the [wiki Documentation](https://github.com/drbenvincent/delay-discounting-analysis/wiki) for full instructions.

Please use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/drbenvincent/delay-discounting-analysis/issues) feature to ask question, report a bug, or request a feature. You'll need a GitHub account to do this, which isn't very hard to set up.

But you could always email me or tweet me [@inferenceLab](https://twitter.com/inferencelab) instead.


## Installation and use
Getting up and running is relatively easy. See the [full installation instructions](https://github.com/drbenvincent/delay-discounting-analysis/wiki/Getting-Started) on the wiki.

The commands use to get your analysis up and running are quite quick and easy. A [demo is provided](https://github.com/drbenvincent/delay-discounting-analysis/tree/master/demo) to show how to use the toolbox with your own data.
