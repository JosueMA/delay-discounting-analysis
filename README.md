THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS CODE FOR A PAPER WHICH IS UNDER PEER REVIEW. FOR THE MOMENT IT IS MADE AVAILABLE JUST FOR THE REVIEWERS. 

PLEASE RESPECT MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - THIS CODE IS UNDER LICENCE. 

I'LL RELEASE THE CODE PROPERLY IF THE PAPER IS ACCEPTED

# Note

The code here is still in flux. I will be:
*  adding more extensive user instructions in the Wiki
*  simplifying the code
*  adding a few features over time

# Instructions

To reproduce the results figures in the paper run `SCRIPT.m`. More extensive usage instructions will follow shortly.
