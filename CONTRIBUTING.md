# Contributing

I'm very happy for anyone to contribute to the project. Feel free to get in touch, or just dive in and make a pull request.


## Folders

* `/ddToolbox` contains all the analysis code and dependencies.
* `/demo` is an example project folder. This particular demo contains participant data, and uses the `ddToolbox` code in order to conduct some analysis and plot some results.
* `/tests` contains a suite of tests. They can be invoked by `runalltests.m`.

## Classes
Much of the code has been written in an Object Oriented style. I have been learning on the job, but the code is much improved from where it started at!

The Matlab convention is that class files start with a capitalized letter.
