This model is experimental and will undergo changes.
It is an attempt at a non-parametric model of the discount function, ie it doesn't make any assumptions about the functional form of the discount rate (such as hyperbolic etc).

We assume we have data from a paradigm that focusses on finding indifference points for a number of delay values.

We can fit these entirely independently, but I have used a Gaussian Random Walk in order to impose some form of continuity / smoothness constraint in the discount fraction as a function of delay.
